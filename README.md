# Cyborg : CBOR library for Java

This project currently consists of:
- **electrode** : low-level reader/writer for CBOR data
- **implant** : low-level reader/writer for CBOR data [*Obsoleted earlier version of electrode*]
- **optics** : eventually a set of transforms from CBOR into other formats. Currently just supports translating binary CBOR into a diagnostic view for debugging purposes
